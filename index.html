                        <td class="student">“Hello, my name is keshav choudhary, and I’m a computer science major. I have experience with several programming languages, including Java, Python, and SQL. I’m particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I’m currently working on a project that involves developing an AI-powered chatbot.

                            Last semester, I worked on a team project that involved developing a mobile app for tracking fitness goals. I learned a lot about software development processes and project management during that experience.
                            
                            After graduation, I hope to work as a software engineer at a tech company, where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects. In my free time, I enjoy attending hackathons and learning about new technologies in the field.
